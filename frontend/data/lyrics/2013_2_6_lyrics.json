    "lyrics": "If you don't fight no one else will\ngive it a try , keep it alive\nTo see the view you got to climb the hill\ngive it a try, get to know why\nIt's been a long way coming\nBut you got to know why and when\nOnly the dead fish follow the stream\nNo, nothing is ever what it seems\nYou can do whatever if you know when and why\nOnly the dead fish follow the stream\nDon't go and get too comfortable\nYou  can't keep it alive\nIf youâ€™re not awake\nI keep a smile through success and mistakes\nCome hell or high water\nI' m'ready, I'm ready\nIt's been a long way coming\nOnly the dead fish follow the stream\nNo, nothing is ever what it seems\nYou can do whatever if you know when and why\nOnly the dead fish follow the stream",
