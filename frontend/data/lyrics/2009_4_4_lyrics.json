    "lyrics": "Mhh\nCloak and dagger man, your just like a toxic drug to me (aha)\nYour tantalizing eyes, start a fire in my blood, you see (aha)\nAnd hey, I know I ought a breakaway\nYour killing me tenderly, everytime you look at me\nOh its so bittersweet baby, baby, dont you know what you do to me\nIts cracking my heart in two, just to come close to you\nAnd I can see it in your eyes, a thief of hearts in disguise\nTrapped in your web and I dont wanna be released, oh no (aha)\nDevour by the game, feeling how the stakes increase (aha)\nAnd hey, I know I oughta breakaway\nYour killing me tenderly, everytime you look at me\nOh its so bittersweet baby, baby, dont you know what you do to me\nIts cracking my heart in two, just to come close to you\nAnd I can see it in your eyes, a thief of hearts in disguise\nAnd though reason tells me get out while you can\nBut damn you, I want you myself\nYour killing me tenderly, everytime you look at me\nOh its so bittersweet baby, baby, dont you know what you do to me\nIts cracking my heart in two, just to come close to you\nAnd I can see it in your eyes, a thief of hearts in disguise\nYour killing me tenderly",
