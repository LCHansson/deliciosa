    "lyrics": "Dreaming, hoping, for another try\nI've been looking, searching, deeper down inside\nAnd if I loose my way, I'll find another road\nCause I can make a change on my own\nI'm moving on\nAnd I'm gonna get stronger now\nAnd nothing will break me down\nI will not give in to doubt\nThose days are gone\nI can be who I wanna be\nAnd start living my life for me\nI believe it finally\nI'm moving on\nSomething, somewhere, that I long to find\nI am learning, slowly, one day at a time\nThat if I loose and fail, I'll be fine\nI'm moving on\nAnd I'm gonna get stronger now\nAnd nothing will break me down\nI will not give in to doubt\nThose days are gone\nI can be who I wanna be\nAnd start living my life for me\nI believe it finally\nI'm moving on\n(I am moving) To a brighter dawn\n(I am moving) Gotta take the fight\n(I am moving) I can make it right\n(I can make it right)\nI'm moving on\nNothing will break me down\nI will not give in to doubt\nThose days are gone\nI can be who I wanna be\nAnd start living my life for me\nI believe it finally\nI'm moving on\n(I am moving)\nYes I'm moving on\n(I am moving)\nI'm moving on",
