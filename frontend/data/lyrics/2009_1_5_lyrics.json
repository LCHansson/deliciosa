    "lyrics": "My lips, on your lips\nYour body heat lingers on me\nOh, what a night\nGod am I obsessed with this man\nOf my dreams\nSo I hide, try to lie\nOnly the nighting gayles\nSings the truth\nBut the rushing of my blood\nIs like rivers running wild\nAnd I got no control and I know\nYou're my world!\nYou're the moon and stars above\nYou're the reason I know love, love, love\nMy only cause for being\nYou're my world!\nYou're the owner of my heart\nAlways close though we're apart, you know\nYou're my heart, my soul, my reason\nYou're my world\nWith hands so soft and gentle\nYou've touched the very core of me\nBut the rushing of my blood\nIs like rivers running wild\nAnd I got no control and I know\nYou're my world!\nYou're the moon and stars above\nYou're the reason I know love, love, love\nMy only cause for being\nYou're my world!\nYou're the owner of my heart\nAlways close though we're apart, you know\nYou're my heart, my soul, my reason\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nBaby, baby, I'm on fire\nCause you make me come alive\nYou're my world\nYou're the reason my love has a name\nYou're the reason I know love, love, love\nMy only cause for being\nYou're my world\nYou're the owner of my heart\nAlways close though we're apart, you know\nYou're my heart, my soul, my reason\nYou're my world\n(You're the moon and stars above)\nYou're my world\n(You're the reason I know love, love, love)\nYou're my world\nMy only cause for being\nMy heart, my soul, my reason\nYou're my world",
