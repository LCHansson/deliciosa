    "lyrics": "I can hear you call my name\nLike a flash from yesterday\nAs if you were here beside me\nIt's all happening again\nThere's no reason to pretend\nWe were made for one another\nSo vividly\nThose memories\nAre taking control over me\nIt's all coming back like a déjà vu\nEverything that you used to do\nWhen you were in my life\nNow I feel that I'm ready to try it again\nIt's all coming back like a déjà vu\nOnce again only me and you\nWe can make it right\nAnd rewind back in time\nAnd start over again\nJust like a déjà vu\nIt feels like we've been here before\nBut this is new of that I'm sure\nNow that you are here to guide me\nSo vividly\nThose memories\nAre taking control over me\nIt's all coming back like a déjà vu\nEverything that you used to do\nWhen you were in my life\nNow I feel that I'm ready to try it again\nIt's all coming back like a déjà vu\nOnce again only me and you\nWe can make it right\nAnd rewind back in time\nAnd start over again\nLike a déjà vu\nI can hear you\nCall my name\nI'm ready to try it again\n(It's all coming back like a déjà vu)\nEverything that you used to do\nWhen you were in my life\nNow I feel that I'm ready to try it again\n(It's all coming back like a déjà vu)\nOnce again only me and you\nWe can make it right\nAnd rewind back in time\nAnd start over again\nJust like a déjà vu",
