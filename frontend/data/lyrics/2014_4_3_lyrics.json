    "lyrics": "Baby\nRemember when we used to say\nSomeday\nWe'll be standing in the colour rain\nSo near but far from what is left\nSave me\ncause without you I'm turning grey\nHollow, making me so hollow\nAll I want is holding you again\ntrying to maintain\nthis sorrow of losing you, it's breaking me\nI need you here again\nbaby I'm afraid cause hollow\nHollow that is all I feel\nI want you back with me\nHelp me\nTell me what am I supposed to do\nI need to\nGet myself a grip of what is true\nI stumble in this endless haze\nNo way\nI can't be around this place for two\nHollow, making me so hollow\nAll I want is holding you again\ntrying to maintain\nThis sorrow of losing you, it's breaking me\nI need you here again\nbaby I'm afraid cause\nI don't wanna hurt\nI don't wanna fall down again\ninto the empty space of hollow\nHollow that is all I feel\nI want you back with mee\nI'm Hollow\nI'm Hooollow\nHollow, making me so hollow\nall I want is holding you again\ntrying to maintain\nthis sorrow of losing you, it's breaking me\nI need you here again\nbaby I'm afraid cause\nI don't wanna hurt\nI don't wanna fall down again,\ninto the empty space of hollow\nHollow that is all I feel\nI want you back with me",
