    "lyrics": "Hey, yeah\nLife,\nIs nothing but a miracle\nTo me it's something mystical\nThat feeling in your heart\n'Cause I,\nI know when you think love is gone\nThen suddenly you are the one\nTo feel it in your heart\nAlthough my hope was gone\nI found a way to move on\nAnd now I am stronger\nI'm back on my feet again\nWhen love's comin' back again\nWhen life turns around and then\nYou think it's from heaven sent\nYou know love is back again\nWhen love's coming over you\nThere's nothing for you to do\nThere's no greater feeling than\nWhen love's comin' back again\nWhen love's comin' back again\nLife,\nSometimes it's so mysterious\nYou never know just what it does\nBut something's in your heart\nAnd then you are stronger\nYou're back on your feet again\nWhen love's comin' back again\nWhen life turns around and then\nYou think it's from heaven sent\nYou know love is back again\nWhen love's coming over you\nThere's nothing for you to do\nThere's no greater feeling than\nWhen love's comin' back again\nWhen love's comin' back again",
