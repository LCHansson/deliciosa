    "lyrics": "So this is it, the final curtain\nThe cold December of our dream\nWhere did it go, what ever happened\nTo our love?\nThe memories from our tomorrow\nAre haunting me from yesterday\nI wonder why we left forever fade away\n??\nClose your eyes\nAnd listen to the breeze tonight\nIs it a lullaby, a song 'bout a butterfly?\nWhy do we say goodbye?\nI see your moon on the horizon\nBut I don't know for what it shines\n'Cause I pray a prayer\nBut I can't find us anywhere\nAnymore\nClose your eyes\nAnd listen to the breeze tonight\nIs it a lullaby, a song 'bout a butterfly?\nWhy do we say goodbye?\n(Close your eyes)\n(And listen to the breeze tonight)\nIs it a lullaby, a song 'bout a butterfly?\nWhy do we say goodbye?\nIs it a lullaby, a song 'bout a butterfly?\nWhy do we say goodbye?",
