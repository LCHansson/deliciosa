    "lyrics": "We had a fight, you cried and ran away\nNow it's late, 4 .am., can't reach you\nIf I could turn back time and make you stay\nMaybe then I would still be near you\nYou're out of my life, it cuts me like a knife\nI'm wounded and it hurts, it hurts, it hurts\nSince I can't tell you\nYou're out of my life but did you have to die?\nAnd now it's too late, too late, too late\nTo say I'm sorry\nIt's taken me across the universe\nYou were there when I was hurtful\nAnd suddenly, one day you left this world\nNow I'm lost on my own, it's over\nYou're out of my life, it cuts me like a knife\nI'm wounded and it hurts, it hurts, it hurts\nSince I can't tell you\nYou're out of my life but did you have to die?\nAnd now it's too late, too late, too late\nTo say I'm sorry\nSorry\n(Aah, aah, aah)\nYou're out of my life, it cuts me like a knife\nI'm wounded and it hurts, it hurts, it hurts\nSince I can't tell you\nYou're out of my life but did you have to die?\nAnd now it's too late, too late, too late\nTo say I'm sorry\nYou're out of my life\n(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts)\n(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts)\nIt hurts, it hurts, it hurts\nSince I can't tell you I'm sorry",
