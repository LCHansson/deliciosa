    "lyrics": "Mmm\nSitting here alone with my memories\nStaring at a picture of you and me\nThey say I look fine but if walls could talk\nThey'd tell you all about how much I break apart\nI think we were right but we did it wrong\nEver since you left me I just can't go on\nNo, I can't even read the news today\nCause everything reminds me of yesterday\nEmpty room, empty heart\nSince you've been gone\nI must move on\nEmpty room\nI never realised it could make me cry\nTo hear the children laugh and play outside\nA walk in the park shouldn't be that bad\nBut everything without you seems to make me sad\nI thought we were good, we were meant to be\nThe way it turned out is still a mystery\nNo, I can't even read the news today\nReminds me of yesterday\nEmpty room, empty heart\nSince you've been gone\nI must move on\nEmpty space, lonely days\nMy life goes on\nJust like the moon\nAnd to sail across the sky alone\nForever trying to find it's home\nI can't believe I have to say\nI don't know where you are today\nEmpty room, empty heart\nSince you've been gone\nI must move on\nEmpty space, lonely days\nMy life goes on\nJust like the moon\nEmpty room, ohh empty room",
