    "lyrics": "How can I go on\nPretending it ain't true\nAnd how can I grow stroong\nWithout that smile I knew\nThere's a tattoo on my heart, saying\nThis belongs to you\nI tried deny it all, but\nThe more I try the more\nI'm longing for you\nSo baby hear me out just one more time\nLets make it turn from black to white\nBeen holding back without a reason why\nBut I'm change it all tonight\nI wanna lose my control\nSo we can get it, get it right\nby the morning\nMy love for you is so.oo\nNa Na Natural so natural\nI wanna lose my control\nSo we can get it, get it right\nby the morning\nMy love for you is so.oo\nNa Na Natural so natural\nHappy hungry eyes\nLet's paint the world in blue\nI wrote this song for yoou\nAnd every word I say is true\nSo baby hear me out just one more time\nLets make it turn from black to white\nBeen holding back without a reason why\nBut I'm change it all tonight\nI wanna lose my control\nSo we can get it, get it right\nby the morning\nMy love for you is so.oo\nNa Na Natural so natural\nI wanna lose my control\nSo we can get it, get it right\nby the morning\nMy love for you is so.oo\nNa Na Natural so natural\nWhat I feel is real\nLet love take the wheal\nWhat I feel is real\nWhat I feel\nWhat I feel is real\nPut your hands up\nLet love take the wheal\nLets go\nOho\nI wanna lose my control\nSo we can get it, get it right\nby the morning\nMy love for you is so.oo\nNa Na Natural so natural\nNa Na Natural so natural\nTo me\nTo me\nTo me",
