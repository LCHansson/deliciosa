    "lyrics": "Who's going to save tonight, It is hard to not give in\nbecause you're no longer breathing and\nwho's going to save tonight if I don’t….\nwho's going to save tonight, I am down on my knees but I'm too proud to say please and\nwho's going to save tonight if you won't\nAll the roads that we’re travelling up and down\ndon't you want our hearts to sing?\nI'll know myself\nbut I wonder where you came from?\nFollowing every step\nup and down, running high\nstill so far away\nand I wonder where you came from\nWho's going to save us now\nwhen our enemies' calling\nwhen I'm down and your falling baby\nwho's going to save us now if we won't\ndon't want to hurt tonight, there is much good in me and there's much good in you so\nwe got to save tonight cause they won't\nAll the roads that we're travelling up and down\ndon't you want our hearts to sing?\nI'll know myself\nbut I wonder where you came from?\nFollowing every step\nup and down, running high\nstill so far away\nand I wonder where you came from\nWhy start a fire when it's all worth saving\ndon't you want to know now don’t you want to feel me closer too\nI walk trough wires cause it’s all worth breaking\ndon't you want to know now don’t you want to feel it close to you\nAll the roads we are travelling up and down\nI would carry anything that's all I know\n(you) got to tell me where you came from…\nfollowing every turn\nup and down want to learn, everything tonight\nand I'm going to go to where you came from\nCause I'm going to go to where you came from\n",
