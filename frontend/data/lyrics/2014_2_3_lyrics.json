    "lyrics": "If only you could tell you are\nA work of art, a shining star,\nYou wouldn't be afraid to shi - i - ine.\nYou focus on what isn't right\nTo hide in shadow, scared of light;\nThe time has come for crossing the li-i-ine\nAccept you're perfection\nAnd see you\nThe way that I do!\nYou - you're incredible, and it shows!\nFrom the inside out, you glow!\nDon't you know, don't you know\nThat you're beautiful in your own way!\nYou're original, head to heel!\nA step beyond unreal!\nDon't you know, don't you know\nThat you're beautiful in your own way!\nYou take a look into my eyes,\nAnd I believe you'll be surprised;\nYou're magic in my point of view - ew - ew.\nYa ready now\nTo take a chance and spread your wings,\nSay I can do it - anything!\nYou're gonna feel like someone new - ew - ew.\nAccept you're perfection\nAnd see you\nThe way that I do!\nYou - you're incredible, and it shows!\nFrom the inside out, you glow!\nDon't you know, don't you know\nThat you're beautiful in your own way!\nYou're original, head to heel!\nA step beyond unreal!\nDon't you know, don't you know\nThat you're beautiful in your own way!\nYou are who you are and who you are\nIs good enough you shouldn't fight it\nBecause you are who you are and who you are you ought to love like I do\nYou - you're incredible, and it shows!\nFrom the inside out, you glow!\nDon't you know, don't you know\nThat you're beautiful in your own way!\nYou're original, head to heel!\nA step beyond unreal!\nDon't you know, don't you know\nThat you're beautiful in your own way!",
