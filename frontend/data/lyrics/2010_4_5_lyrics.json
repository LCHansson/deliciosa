    "lyrics": "I go, down the beaten track\nalong the river with an empty bag\nAt the end she said to me: Why are you here, with the autumn leaves?\nCause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand\nCause this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else\nIm done, tipping on my toes\nstrike an iron and attack my soul\nMisty moon, youre gonna see\nIve got you blues to get on my feet\nCause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand\nCause this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else\nI dont wanna run; I dont wanna fight\nI dont wanna hide; I just wanna stay free, to be me\nI dont wanna win; I dont wanna lose\nI dont wanna play; I just wanna remember, oh my name\nCause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand\nOh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n(Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand)\nCause this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else\nCause this is my life, my friend, and I cant be no one else\nCause this is my life, my friend",
