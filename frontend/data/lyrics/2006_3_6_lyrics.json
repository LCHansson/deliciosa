    "lyrics": "La la la la la\nLa la la la la\nLet the golden star\nKnow anywhere you are\nEveryone who breaths in sorrow\nNeed a place to call there home\nLooking for a new tomorrow\nHeaven thinks forever more\nFar up in heaven the light shines for you\nLet the golden star\nKnow anywhere you are\nGlimmer right into your heart\nLiving all your dreams\nAll the faith you need\nAnywhere you are\nAnyone to fear the darkness\nNever need to walk alone\nLight will be the caring mother\nIn your dreams your on you own\nStrong winds from heaven\nThey whisper your name\nLet the golden star\nKnow anywhere you are\nGlimmer right into your heart\nLiving all your dreams\nAll the faith you need\nAnywhere you are\nLet the golden star\nKnow anywhere you are\nGlimmer right into your heart\nLiving all your dreams\nAll the faith you need\nAnywhere you are tonight\n(Let the golden star\nKnow anywhere you are)\nGlimmer right into your heart\nLiving all your dreams\nAll the faith you need\nAnywhere you are\nFind your golden star tonight",
