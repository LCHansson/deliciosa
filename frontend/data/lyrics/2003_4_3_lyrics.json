K. O\nYou won't be saved by the bell\n(TK.O)\nThis place is hotter than hell\nPray you will live to tell\nKnock you out, down to the floor\nDJ's gonna hit it get ready for more\nKnock you out, out of control\nThis beat is gonna take you to a T.(T) K.(K)\nKnock you out, down to the floor\nDJ's gonna hit it get ready for more\nKnock you out, out of control\nThis beat is gonna take you to a T. K. O",
