    "lyrics": "I don't know, what's happening to me\nAll I know, is that I want you around me\nNothing's holding me back, from you tonight\nWatch the sun, as the night fills the sky\nI can see, my reflection your gend likes\nAs we suddenly kiss, and the stars come alive\nAnd I want you tonight\nTonight's the night\nThe moon is in our hands, and I wisper I surrender\nTonight's the night\nAnd I've given it all I can, and you hold me off so tender\nOhh, I love you more tonight\nAs the sun's, light fills the sky\nThe dawn is breakin', but we're still holdin' longtime\nYou'll be here with me, wherever I go\nAnd I want you tonight\nTonight's the night\nThe moon is in our hands, and I wisper I surrender\nTonight's the night\nAnd I've given it all I can, and you hold me off so tender\nOhh, I love you more tonight\nIf I could freeze a moment in my life, I\nwould have the moment here with you tonight\nI believe\nTonight's the night\nThe moon is in our hands\nTonight's the night\nAnd I've given it all I can, and you hold me off so tender\nOhh, I love you more tonight\n(Tonight's the night)\n(Tonight's the night)",
