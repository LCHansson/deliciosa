I was so secure\nAnd you don't have a clue\nJust what I'm 'bout to do\nGuess who won the lottery?\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to hit you up\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to fill your cup\nI'll let you dive and swim in my ocean\nTonight, tonight my heart is wide open\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to hit you up\nLucky, lucky you\nLucky, lucky me\nLucky you\nVers 2\nBut wait a minute, Am l aloud to feel this way\nAnd if it's all inside my head\nThen I am sorry, but I'll think\nI gotta tell you straight\nI feel a thing I never felt before\nAlmost impossible to ignore\nAnd I don't give a damn\nIt's all part of the plan\nGuess who won the lottery?\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to hit you up\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to fill your cup\nI'll let you dive and swim in my ocean\nTonight, tonight my heart is wide open\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to hit you up\nLucky, lucky you\nLucky, lucky me\nLucky you\nI played my cards, and I have delt my heart\nIf this is meant to be ill leave it up to you\nOoa, Ooa Lucky you\nOoa, Ooa Lucky you\nI'll let you dive and Swim in my ocean\nTonight, tonight my heart is wide open\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to hit you up\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to fill your cup\nI'll let you dive and swim in my ocean\nTonight, tonight my heart is wide open\nLucky, lucky you\nI'm about to hit you up\nLucky, lucky you\nLucky, lucky me\nLucky you",
