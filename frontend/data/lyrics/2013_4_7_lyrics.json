    "lyrics": "It's your life, it's your moment\nAnd they're holding their breath cause tonight\nIt's your time to step into the light\nThey have kept you for years now\nAnd they've told you how you should behave\nNow it’s you and your own ways\nBreaking the silence, break the chains\nWelcome to freedom, to a new day\nWhere all of the teardrops turn to gold\nYou're gonna be all right, so let go\nDon't look down on your feet dear\nDon't start pulling your shirt when you know\nIt’s your life and it's beautiful\nWho said perfect is pretty?\nWho said you're the mistakes you have made?\nLift your eyes and stand up straight\n‘Cause you have no idea how strong you are",
