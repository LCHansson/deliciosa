    "lyrics": "Look at me, walking alone in this beautiful weather\nHere I am, happy as can be\nLook at me, floating above as light as a feather\nHere I am â€“ young, in love and free\nI used to get by with a little help\nBut now I make it on my own\nI can't deny it wasn't always easy\nI used to get by with a little help\nBut now I make it on my own\nI can't deny it wasn't always easy\nLook at her, curly red hair and beautiful eyes\nHere she is, glowing like the stars above\nShe can be the future inspiration for the rest of my life\nYes she is my muse, my love, my life\n(Da-ta-da)\nI used to get by with a little help\nBut now I make it on my own\nI can't deny it wasn't always easy\n(Da-ta-da)\nI used to get by with a little help\nBut now I make it on my own\nI can't deny it wasn't always easy\nOoh, there were times when I was regretful, I was disrespectful\nThere were times in my life\nWhen I thought that I never would be someone like me today\nBut people change, I am what I am and I love life in so many ways\nOoh-oh-oh-oooooooooh\n(Da-ta-da)\nI used to get by with a little help\nBut now I make it on my own\nI can't deny it wasn't always (it wasn't, it wasn't) easy\n(I used to get by with a little help)\n(But now)But now I make it (you can't deny it wasn't always easy)\nI can't deny-y-y-y (I used to get by with a little help)\nBut now I make it on my own (can't deny it wasn't always easy)\n(Da-ta-da)\nI used to get by with a little help\nBut now I make it on my own",
