    "lyrics": "I try to sleep\nIn a bed on fire\nA change must come\nNo matter how\nThere's no return\nAshes to ashes\nDust to dust\nBut everything will burn\nOnce again, the night has fallen\nHard thoughts, keep on crawling\nLying awake, desperate yawning\nSoon it's here that bloody morning\nI don't like to be frustrated\nI don't want to be sedated\nWho's gonna' be my saviour?\nWonder if Iâ€™ll ever make it\nI try to sleep\nIn a bed on fire\nA change must come\nNo matter how\nThere's no return\nAshes to ashes\nDust to dust\nBut everything will burn\nI could use some hibernation\nBe an interstellar spaceman\nOne more night , and I'll go crazy\nRest would be a new sensation\nEarly riser, duties calling\nWhat a life, it's so boring\nI wanna' snooze, oh no!\nHere it comes that bloody morning",
