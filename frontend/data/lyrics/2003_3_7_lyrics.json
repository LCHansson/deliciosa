    "lyrics": "Did you think you'd stop my heart the day you said goodbye?\nDid you think I'd crumble inside?\nWell I hate to tell you\nBut I'm doing just fine\nI loved you hard, I loved you long\nBut now my love is moving on\nTouch me now\nSing with me that nevermore refrain somehow\nTime has come to give my very last goodbye\nI'm running out of tears\nI've been facing all my fears\nMr. Memory, you and me are history\nNot that I forgot the nights of endless, aching pain\nI didn't think I'd ever find my strength again\nBut look who's still standing with eyes out of tears\nI loved you hard, I loved you long\nBut now my love is moving on\nTouch me now\nSing with me that nevermore refrain somehow\nTime has come to give my very last goodbye\nI'm running out of tears\nI've been facing all my fears\nMr. Memory, you and me are history\nNow that I know who you are\nTomorrow belongs to me, and now\nI'm free to live my life\nTouch me now\nSing with me that nevermore refrain somehow\nCause time has come to give my very last goodbye\nI'm running out of tears\nI've been facing all my fears\nMr. Memory, you and me are history",
