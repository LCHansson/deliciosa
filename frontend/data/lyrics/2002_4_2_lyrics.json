    "lyrics": "You kept me holding on\nI'm always the last to know\nUhh, yeah\nWhen I saw you out with her\nI was torn in pieces\nFelt like something died inside me\nAnd I never find the words\nNever know the reasons\nI just put it all behind me\nBut before I go\nI want you to know\nJust how much I loved you\nYou kept me holding on\nNow I can't let you go\nSo tell me where we went wrong\nI'm always the last to know\nAfter all the things we shared\nAll our times together\nAfter all the nights you held me\nIf you really didn't care\nIf we're lost forever\n(If we're lost forever)\nBaby I thought you would tell me\nHow could I be blind?\nWas it all a lie?\nDid you ever loved me?\nYou kept me holding on\nNow I can't let you go\nSo tell me where we went wrong\nI'm always the last to know\nUuhh, uuhh\nThe last to know\nWill it ever turn out right\nWhen our love was sended\nWill I ever always be a last to know\nYou kept me holding on\nNow I can't let you go\nSo tell me where we went wrong\nI'm always the last to know\nYou kept me holding on\nNow I can't let you go\nSo tell me where we went wrong\nI'm always the last to know",
