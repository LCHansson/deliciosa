    "lyrics": "We've got to make a move\nTake a chance\nWhile the night is young\nOn sweet romance\nThough we fuzz and fight\nYou're my song and dance\nAlmost every night\nYour heart is mine\nYeah, we break up a little bit\nMake up a little bit\nShape up a little bit\nTry some harder\nAnd that's just a part of it\nIt's all for a little bit of love\nWe've come a long, long way\nFrom the world we knew\nAnd the streets we played\nIn our neighbourhood\nNo matter what they say\nAbout me and you\nWe live the way we do\nThe way we do\nYeah, we break up a little bit\nMake up a little bit\nShape up a little bit\nTry some harder\nAnd that's just a part of it\nIt's all for a little bit of love\nOhh, you better believe it (aha)\nDarling, ohh,\nYou better believe it\nWe all need it\nSo we break up a little bit\nMake up a little bit\nShape up a little bit\nTry some harder\nAnd that's just a part of it\nIt's all for a little bit of love\nHeey!\nOhh, you better believe it (aha)\nDarling, ohh,\nYou better believe it\nWe all need it\nI wanna be with you\nIn every room\nI wanna walk with you\nAs bride and groom\nThough we crash and burn\nWe're still in bloom\nIt's a give and take\nAnd you're my fate\nSo we break up a little bit\nMake up a little bit\nShape up a little bit\nTry some harder\nAnd that's just a part of it\nYeah, we're always gonna\nBreak up a little bit\nMake up a little bit\nShape up a little bit\nTry some harder\nAnd that's just a part of it\nIt's all for a little bit of love\nAnd that's just a part of it\nIt's all for a little bit of love",
