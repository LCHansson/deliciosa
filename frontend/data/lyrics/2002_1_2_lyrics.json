    "lyrics": "She's got a special gift\nShe knows how to use\nShe's a devil in disguise\nShe makes me intoxicated\nLook into her eyes\nTelling me that she will stay\nBut then she turns away\nShe's always in disguise\nAnd she gets away with lies\nShe's making me come back as\nBlue as her angel eyes\nBlue as her angel eyes\nI tried so many ways\nI feel like a fool\nI guess I have to play that part\nWent to see my best friend\nAnd it nearly broke my heart\nTo find her earring on his floor\nBehind the bedroom door\nShe's always in disguise\nAnd she gets away with lies\nShe's making me come back as\nBlue as her angel eyes\nBlue as her angel eyes\nThen the one I called my friend\nThat used to be so cool\nWas acting more and more like me\nAnother crazy fool\nBlue as her angel eyes\nBlue as her angel eyes\nShe's always in disguise\nAnd she gets away with lies\nShe's making me come back as\nBlue as her angel eyes\nBlue as her angel eyes\nShe's always in disguise\nAnd she gets away with lies\nShe's making me come back as\nBlue as her angel eyes\nBlue as her angel eyes\nBlue as her, blue as her\nBlue as her angel eyes",
