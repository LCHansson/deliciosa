    "lyrics": "I want my heart unbroken\nI need my soul to heal at last\nWhat can you say to make me forget the past\nIf you decide to come home\nI can't take that again\nNo more\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nI pray that you would stay\nNot turn and walk away\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nCome back if love is true\nI'm hollow without you\nWhy should I trust your sad eyes\nWhat if you leave one rainy night\nYou've got to make a promise\nPromise me to stay and fight\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nI pray that you would stay\nNot turn and walk away\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nCome back if love is true\n'Cause I'm hollow without you\nIf you love me\nI f you need me\nYou will be there\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nDon't turn and walk away\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nI pray that you would stay\nNot turn and walk away\nDon't leave me now\nI'm hollow\nCome back if love is true\n'Cause I'm hollow without you\nI'm hollow without you",
