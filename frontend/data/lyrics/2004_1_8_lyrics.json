    "lyrics": "Hypnotized by the look in your eyes\nCheek to cheek with our heads held up high\nSense the rhythm that's beating within\nYou're hot, we dance skin to skin\nOne lick from the tip of your tongue\nTeasin' me, the evenings still young\nSo exciting, so inviting\nCome, let's go!\nTango! Tango!\nCome on let's tango you and I\nTango! Tango!\nUntil the morning will arrive\nTango! Tango!\nLet's do the tango you and I\nHold me tight and dance all night and don't let go\nFace to face, you're starring at me\nWith you're hand's clutching mine desperately\nDrops of sweat slowly runs down my neck\nI'm hot, we move forth and back\nOne kiss on my red shining lips\nI'm surrounded by your fingertips\nSo exciting, so inviting\nCome, let's go!\nTango! Tango!\nCome on let's tango you and I\nTango! Tango!\nUntil the morning will arrive\nTango! Tango!\nLet's do the tango you and I\nHold me tight and dance all night and don't let go\nTa- tango!\nTa- tango!\nTa- tango!\nTango!\nTango! Tango!\nCome on let's tango you and I\nTango! Tango!\nUntil the morning will arrive\nTango! Tango!\nLet's do the tango you and I\nHold me tight and dance all night and don't let go\nTa\nTa- tango!\nTa\nCome on, let's tango you and I",
