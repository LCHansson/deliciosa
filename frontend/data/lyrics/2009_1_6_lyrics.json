    "lyrics": "I can feel your force right across the floor.\nEvery look I take makes me want you more.\nNow we're all alone and the time is right.\nSo don't even try telling me goodbye.\nSo why do you need to go when we've just begun?\nWe got time.\nCome inside, come inside!\nStay the night.\nWon't you stay the night?\nI can be your lover.\nHold on tight.\nStay the night.\nIf you stay the night\nI can be your guide to paradise.\nEverybody's looking for the pot of gold.\nTrouble is to find it and we still don't know.\nI was never one to let the chances slip\nwith a boy like you at my fingertips.\nSo why do you wanna go when we're just getting hot?\nWe got time.\nCome inside! Come inside!\nStay the night.\nWon't you stay the night?\nI can be your lover.\nHold on tight.\nStay the night.\nIf you stay the night\nI can be your guide to paradise.\nStay the night.\nWon't you stay the night?\nI can be your lover.\nHold on tight.\nStay the night.\nIf you stay the night\nI can be your guide to paradise.\nBut baby it's cold outside\nso just make up your mind.\nBaby, this is a once in a lifetime.\n(I can be your lover, lover, lover, lover, lover,\nstay the night, the night, the night,)\nStay the night.\nWon't you stay the night?\nI can be your lover.\nHold on tight.\nStay the night.\nIf you stay the night\nI can be your guide to paradise.\nStay the night.\nWon't you stay the night?\nI can be your lover.\nHold on tight.\nStay the night.\nIf you stay the night\nI can be your guide to paradise.\nBaby, what a shame not a cab in sight.",
