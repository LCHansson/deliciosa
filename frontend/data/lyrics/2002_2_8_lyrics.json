    "lyrics": "You said you'd love me for the rest of our days\nBut time has changed and so have we with it\nSome broken promises and a few mistakes\nI see no reason why you can't be mine\nI see no reason, all we need is time\nSail away with me\nAnd ride the waves across the ocean\nLike it used to be\nWhen we set our sails in motion\nThere's no time to say goodbye\nWe got to go before the tide\nLeaves us on the shore\nLike so many times before\nDo you remember the games we played?\nThose times were beautiful, why did it end?\nIf you still love me just take my hand\nI see no reason why you can't be mine\nI see no reason, babe it ain't no crime\nSail away with me\nAnd ride the waves across the ocean\nLike it used to be\nWhen we set our sails in motion\nThere's no time to say goodbye\nWe got to go before the tide\nLeaves us on the shore\nLike so many times before\nBefore I go to sleep\nI hope and pray you keep\nThose words you gave to me\nDon't be afraid, come on\nAnd sail away with me,\nSail away with me (far away)\nAnd ride the waves across the ocean\nLike it used to be\nWhen we set our sails in motion\nThere's no time to say goodbye\nWe got to go before the tide\nLeaves us on the shore\nLike so many times before\n(Sail away) Oooh woah oh\n(Across the ocean)\nLike it used to be\nWhen we set our sails in motion\nThere's no time to say goodbye\nWe got to go before the tide\nLeaves us on the shore\nLike so many times before",
