    "lyrics": "A flashing chrome-man lighting up the night\nHeading downtown invited\nPast city lights, a silver moon igniting memories\nTonight I'm losing track of time and place\nI'm back in Space when he was coming down the stairs\nTonight I'll be like Armstrong\nand I'm doing what seems impossible\nTonight I'll be the rocket man\nAnd make it look incredible\nJust like 40 years ago\nStill, it's a thrill to walk in the unknown without fear\nTonight I'm being at the edge of the human frontier\n(At the edge of the human frontier)\nHe brought his Eagle to a touchdown phase\nWith 30 seconds left to crash and fade\nThe guys at Houston got their breath in pace\nAround the world folks heard him tell his words\nOf destiny, whilst stepping into history\nTonight I'll be like Armstrong\nand I'm doing what seems impossible\nTonight I'll be the rocket man\nAnd make it look incredible\nJust like 40 years ago\nStill, it's a thrill to walk in the unknown without fear\nTonight I'm being at the edge of the human frontier\n(At the edge of the human frontier)\nWoh, oh, oh\nOoh\nI wanna find what Mankind is unaware of outside Mars\nI wanna go to those undiscovered corners of the stars\nTonight I'll be like Armstrong\nand I'm doing what seems impossible\nTonight I'll be the rocket man\nAnd make it look incredible\nJust like 40 years ago\nStill, it's a thrill to walk in the unknown without fear\nTonight I'm being at the edge of the human frontier\nHuman frontier",
