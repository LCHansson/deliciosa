    "lyrics": "I hear the sound of heartbeats\nThat's fading into emptiness\nThroughout the night I travel\nIn the distance with my loneliness\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of\nInside my heart it's wretching\nI am longing for real wilderness\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of\nAll this time on my own\nI never thought that I could feel sorrow\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of\nFinally I've become the hunter\nHunting for the love I am worthy of",
