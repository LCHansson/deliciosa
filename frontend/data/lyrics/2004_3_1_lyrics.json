    "lyrics": "It's getting hot we blow the spot!\nParty's getting started, lights are getting low\nSomething is about to explode\nSouls are shaken\nAnd hearts are taken around you, yeah, yeah\nCome a little closer and moving to the vibe\nShow me that you're up for the ride\nThe bass is pumping\nAnd people jumping around you, yeah, yeah\nSo you got what it takes\nCan you handle the case?\nThen everything will be alright\nEverybody's going\nDown! Down! Down!\nBouncing getting it on to the music\nWe blow the spot\nBouncing, making it right while we crusing\nIt's getting hot we blow the spot!\nCranking up the level, speeding down the lane\nEverybody's going insane\nAll the girls are flying\nAnd the boys are trying around you, yeah, eh\nMaking our connections, talking through the eyes\nKnowing that tonight is the night\nAnd it feels so good\nLike I know it would around you, ooh ooh ooh\nSo you got what it takes\nCan you handle the case?\nThen everything will be alright\nEverybody's going\nDown! Down! Down!\nBouncing, getting it on to the music\nWe blow the spot\nBouncing, making it right while we crusing\nIt's getting hot we blow the spot!\nSwing it, shake it\nSliding to the left\nWe're moving and kicking\nSliding to the right, come on\nSo you got what it takes\nCan you handle the case?\nThen everything will be alright\nDown! Down! Down!\nBouncing, getting it on to the music (to the music)\nWe blow the spot\nBouncing, making it right while we crusing\nIt's getting hot we blow the spot!\nBouncing, getting it on to the music\nWe blow the spot (we blow the spot)\nBUBBLES making it right while we crusing\nIt's getting hot we blow the spot!",
