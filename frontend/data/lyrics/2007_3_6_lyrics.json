    "lyrics": "You see me running like I'm out of my mind\nA cloud of worries staying close behind\nA constant pain of working overtime\nI'm just another face in another line\nBut there is hope to seek in times of madness\nThis day is almost done\nWhen the night comes falling I'll be calling\nWe'll go crazy and spend our pay\nAs the sun is setting we're forgetting\nEverything will be okey\nEverything will be okey\nAnother day and I am done once more\nI keep on working but don't know what for\nA lot of effort for a tiny score\nBut none of this will matter when I'm gone for sure\nBut there is hope to seek in times of madness\nCause time is on our side\nWhen the night comes falling I'll be calling\nWe'll go crazy and spend our pay\nAs the sun is setting we're forgetting\nEverything will be okey\nEverything will be okey\nIt takes a dream to keep us alive\nTo keep us moving on\nAnd though it seems we're just getting by\nTogether we're still strong\n(Together we're still strong)\nWhen the night comes falling I'll be calling\nWe'll go crazy and spend our pay\nAs the sun is setting we're forgetting\nEverything will be okey\n(When the night comes falling I'll be calling)\nThe night will get you through the day\nAs the sun is setting we're forgetting\nEverything will be okey\nEverything will be okey",
