    "lyrics": "When time goes by in a disarray\nAnd thoughts collide every step of the way\nIt's hard to stand your ground again\nWhen you feel you're being betrayed\nYou need someone that can point the way\nTo lead you past all the shades of grey\nTo show you where you need to be\nThe means to save the day\nOhh-oh, I don't know how it feels to always wanna run\nAnd I don't know what it means to be dying just to live\nWhat if you were left with a stone cold heart?\nAnd you were all alone, just fallin' apart?\nWould you rise again? Would you rise again?\nWhat if hope was lost for a hundred days?\nAnd you feel your life was just slippin' away?\nWould you rise again? Would you rise again?\nWhat if?\nWhen dreams are made of the simple stuff\nThe right to choose and to say enough\nWhen all you want is life again\nIt's hard to be that tough, oh\nI don't know how it feels to always wanna run\nAnd I don't know what it means to be dying just to live\nWhat if you were left with a stone cold heart?\nAnd you were all alone, just fallin' apart?\nWould you rise again? Would you rise again?\nWhat if hope was lost for a hundred days?\nAnd you feel your life was just slippin' away?\nWould you rise again? Would you rise again?\nWhat if?\nWhat if you were left with a stone cold heart?\nAnd you were all alone, just fallin' apart?\nWould you rise again? Would you rise again?\nWhat if hope was lost for a hundred days?\nAnd you feel your life was just slippin' away?\nWould you rise again? Would you rise again?\nWhat if? What if",
