    "lyrics": "Even if I could\nI wouldn't leave you crying\nEven if I should\nAnd there is no use denying\nThat you and I belong together\nWe share a hidden past\nAnd nothing short of my forever\nAnd yours is what I ask\nI don't have much to give you\nI don't have much to share\nI reach as far as I dare go\nAnd pray I'll find you there\nWhispers in the dark\nKisses that are burning\nClouding up my heart\nLeaving but I'm yearning\nYou and I belong together\nWe share a hidden past\nAnd nothing short of my forever\nAnd yours is what I ask\nI don't have much to give you\nI don't have much to share\nI reach as far as I dare go\nAnd pray I'll find you there\nI don't have much to offer\nJust body, mind and soul\nSo tell me what you need\nJust what you ask of me\nAnd that is where I'll go\nAnd that is where I'll go",
