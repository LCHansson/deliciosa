    "lyrics": "When the day breaks \nand your heart aches\nWhen you feel like\nyour soul is crying\nYour head hurts\nand your mind's a blur\nWhen you're ready\nto give up trying\nYou have to see through the dark\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nTo the end of the world\nTo the end of the universe\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nTo the end of the road\nin a place where the stars don't shine\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nWhen the day breaks\nin this cold place\nWhen you feel like\nthere's something missing\nYour head hurts\nand your mind's a blur\nWhen you realize you're second guessing\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nTo the end of the world\nTo the end of the universe\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nTo the end of the road\nIn a place where the stars don't shine\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nCan you see me\nCan you feel me\nCan you hear me\nI'm screaming for you\nMy head hurts\nand my mind's a blur\nbut I know that you'll always be here\nTo the end of the world\nTo a place where the stars don't shine\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nTo the end of the world\nTo the end of the universe\nTo the end of the road\nTo a place where the stars\ndon't shiiine\nOho\nYou will be loved, will be loved\nBe loved\nBe loved",
