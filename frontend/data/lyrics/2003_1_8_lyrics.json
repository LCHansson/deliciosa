    "lyrics": "Let your spirit fly, we can touch the sky\nI will surrender to your love\n(Jan Johansen)\nWalking down a crowded avenue\nAnd there are strangers everywhere\nBut not a face of all the people that I see\nCan thrill me like the way you do\n(Pernilla Wahlgren)\nYou seem so close but yet so far from here\nI wanna be right where you are\nAnd I would walk the moon and back if you were mine\nI'll never let you go\n(Chorus:)\nLet your spirit fly, over mountains high\nSpread your wings like an angel in heaven above\nLet your spirit fly, we can touch the sky\nI will surrender to your love\n(Jan Johansen)\nSmoother than a summer evening breeze (evening breeze)\nYou wash away my cares with ease\nSuddenly the world seems such a perfect place\nWhere dreams may come alive\n(Chorus:)\nLet your spirit fly, over mountains high\nSpread your wings like an angel in heaven above\nLet your spirit fly, we can touch the sky\nI will surrender to your love\n(Jan Johansen)\nAnd I have had my share of heartache and pain (heartache and pain)\nDon't wanna face it all again\n(Pernilla Wahlgren)\nNo, but I can promise you I'll stay for good\nCause love will lead the way\n(Pernilla Wahlgren) Love will lead the waaaaay\n(Jan Johansen) Let your spirit fly\n(Chorus:)\nLet your spirit fly, over mountains high\nSpread your wings like an angel in heaven above\nLet your spirit fly, we can touch the sky\nI will surrender to your love\nI will surrender to your love",
