    "lyrics": "Thought it´d be easy \nNow its getting critical\nYou´re out of my life now\nIts unbelievable \nThe more things change they stay the same\nThought I could take it\nBut I am unable\nIt is too much to handle\nIt isn´t over until its over\nGot the heart of an ox\nGot the skin of a dragon\nI´m a fighter, always standing up\nNow the weakness talks\nIm on my knees, and i´m about to drop\nIts a mystery\nWhy I cant stop thinking of you\nMystery\nHow everything circles around you\nIn my mind\nI´m doing all in my power\nTo get free\nIn my mind\nI promised myself till this day I´d be\nBut its a mystery\nCan feel your presence \nCan smell your fragrance\nAs if you stood beside me\nIt isn´t over until it´s over\nIm not gonna cry\nI´ve been thought better than that\nMy eyes are too fucking dry \nNow Isn´t that ironic?\nThis is my own fight\nI´m gonna wear it out\nI´m gonna bleed it out\nIts a mystery\nWhy I cant stop thinking of you\nMystery\nHow everything circles around you\nIn my mind\nI´m doing all in my power\nTo get free\nIn my mind\nI promised myself till this day I´d be\nBut its a mystery\nNow it´s critical \nNow it´s critical\nIt´s unbelievable\nIt´s unbelievable\nIt´s unbelievable\nIt´s unbelievable\nIts a mystery\nWhy I cant stop thinking\nIts a mystery\nHow everything circles around you\nIn my mind\nI´m doing all in my power\nTo get free\nIn my mind\nI promised myself till this day I´d be\nBut its a mystery\n",
