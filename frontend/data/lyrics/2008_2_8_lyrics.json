    "lyrics": "Here in this place I never thought we'd be today\nAfter all that we've been through, we've come a long way\nTogether, you and I\nHere I will rest my case and let my weakness show\nI've got nothing left to prove and I will follow\nThis new road tonight\nAll I want (All I want), all I need (All I need)\nIs for you to stand by me\nOh baby, one love\nWalking in the darkness I need one love\nAlways there to help and guide me\nOne love, that's all I need\nOne love\nBigger than the two of us now, one love\nI'm not afraid to put my trust in one love\nThat's all I need\nI can see the million tears that left your eyes\nAnd I can hear the words that hurt you\nI can feel you, the thorn in your side\nI'll take you in (I'll take you in),\nI'll see you through (I'll see you through)\nAnd I'll be there to stand by you\nOh baby, one love\nWalking in the darkness I need one love\nAlways there to help and guide me\nOne love, that's all I need\nOne love\nBigger than the two of us now, one love\nI'm not afraid to put my trust in one love\nThat's all I need\nWhen the world\nIs cold outside\nAnd I need a place to hide\nYou are there (You are there), holding on (Holding on)\nLet me know I'm not alone\nI'm not alone\nOne love\nWalking in the darkness I need one love\nAlways there to help and guide me\nOne love, that's all I need\nOne love\nBigger than the two of us now, one love\nI'm not afraid to put my trust in one love\nThat's all I need\nStanding here tonight beside me\nOne love, that's all I need",
