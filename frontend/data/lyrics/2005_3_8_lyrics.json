    "lyrics": "I've got a room here at the Mandalay bay\nI'll take a shower then I'm on my way\nI'll bring a friend if someone picks a fight\nHere in Las Vegas tonight\nIt's close to midnight when I hit the strip\nThe maiden voyage on my Vegas trip\nThe night is young and everything's alright\nHere in Las Vegas tonight\nDancing girls and cabarets\nYou can spend your money in a million ways\nLet's have a ball\nThe winner takes it all\nIn Las Vegas\nIn the neon lights\nYou'll be a star if you do it right\nIn Las Vegas\nOh oh oh\nYou better hold on tight\nIn Las Vegas\nCan't believe your eyes\nYour luck can turn in a throw of a dice\nIn Las Vegas\nOh oh oh\nYou better hold on tight\nHere in Las Vegas tonight\nI'm leaving with a million dollar smile\nThe hotel manager can check my file\nFred the Limo-driver's asking polite\n- Leaving Las Vegas tonight?\nDancing girls and cabarets\nYou can spend your money in a million ways\nLet's have a ball\nThe winner takes it all\nIn Las Vegas\nIn the neon lights\nYou'll be a star if you do it right\nIn Las Vegas\nOh oh oh\nYou better hold on tight\nHey, yeah yeah\n(In Las Vegas)\nIn Las Vegas\nIn Las Vegas\nIn the neon lights\nYou'll be a star if you do it right\n(In Las Vegas)\nOh oh oh\nYou better hold on tight\nIn Las Vegas\nCan't believe your eyes\nYour luck can turn in a throw of a dice\nIn Las Vegas\nOh oh oh\nYou better hold on tight\nHere in Las Vegas tonight",
