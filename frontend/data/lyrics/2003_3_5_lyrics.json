    "lyrics": "I wash my mind out in the summer rain\nAnd feel a breeze touching my soul\nWhen I'm not with him then I understand\nI'm but half without his hand to hold\nI wrote his name up in the sky one day\nBut silent winds blew it away\nAnd so I wrote it in my heart instead\nAn that is where it will always stay\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nWatch me now for eternity\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nPromise once and again\nMy love will go on with you near my love\nThe lonely silence of the rising sun\nLeaves floating gently down the stream\nConstant reminders of sweet harmony\nI can swear that we were ment to be\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nWatch me now for eternity\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nPromise once and again\nMy love will go on with you near my love\nIf you see me falling down, falling down, falling down\nYou can bring the light along and shine\n'Cause I'm yours and you are mine\nFor eternity\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nPromise once and again\nMy love will go on\nMy love will go on with you near my love",
