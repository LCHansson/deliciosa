    "lyrics": "Everything has a beginning\nEverything comes to an end\nTake it or leave it\nYou'd better believe it\nBe my lover, be my friend\nTry to deny what you're feeling\nand you know that your heart will say no\nLove will last longer\nGrowing stronger and stronger\nIf you stay and don't let go\nOh-oh\nOut of the light\nLike a star, like a hero\nLove will survive\nOh-oh\nTaking a fight is the life of a hero\nStaying alive\nThis is a story of love and compassion\nOnly heroes can tell\nOh-oh\nOut of the light\nLike a star, like a hero\nLove will survive\nHeaven and earth keep colliding\nBut we love on a world of its own\nOh, there you can't fake it\nJust make it or break it\nOnly you can find the one\nOh-oh\nOut of the light\nLike a star, like a hero\nLove will survive\nOh-oh\nTaking a fight is the life of a hero\nStaying alive\nThis is a story of love and compassion\nOnly heroes can tell\nOh-oh\nOut of the light\nLike a star, like a hero\nLove will survive\nOoh-ooh survive\nHeroes can live on their own\nBut heroes never die alone\nOh-oh\nOut of the light\nLike a star, like a hero\nLove will survive\nOh-oh\nTaking a fight is the life of a hero\nStaying alive\nThis is a story of love and compassion\nOnly heroes can tell\nOh-oh\nOut of the light\nLike a star, like a hero\nLove will survive",
