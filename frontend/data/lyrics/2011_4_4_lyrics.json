    "lyrics": "One heart asking\nGive me love, give me love\nOne soul praying\nGive me love, give me love\nOne day without you was more than I could take\nI thought I would break\nSomething came alive\nJust when I thought that all was gone\nSomething came alive\nWhen I thought it was over\nYou're the only one, the only one\nWe're stronger than before\nSomething came alive\nSomething came alive\nOne light burning\nGive me hope, give me hope\nOne star is falling, tonight\nSomething came alive\nJust when I thought that all was gone\nSomething came alive\nWhen I thought it was over\nYou're the only one, the only one\nWe're stronger than before\nSomething came alive\n(Didn't know) how much I'd miss you\nDidn't know how to survive\nThrough it all, we kept our love alive\nOne heart asking\nGive me love\nSomething came alive\nJust when I thought that all was gone\nSomething came alive\nWhen I thought it was over\nYou're the only one, the only one\nWe're stronger than before\nSomething came alive\nJust when I thought that all was gone\nSomething came alive\nWhen I thought that it was over\nYou're the only one, the only one\nWe're stronger than before\nSomething came alive\nSomething came alive\nSomething came alive",
