    "lyrics": "She said there's so much beauty\nThere is a heaven in your mind\nAnd in your heart you hold the key\nStill you may never find it\nCause no one else can take you there\nIt's everywhere and yours for free\nAnd she said:\nAll the money in the world won't get you far\nAdmit it's free and just right where you are\nYou will never know how close you are\nBecause\nLove is all, you can see the wonders of your heart\nLove is all, it will tell how wonderful we are\nLove is all, you can see the magic of this world\nLove is all\nMakes you feel better, so much better\nSo much better\nUpon the gleaming waters\nThey paints their waves in colours bright\nIt all dissolves inside of you\nAnd she said:\nLove will make you shine just like a star\nOnce you understand that we all are\nBrothers in the kingdom of the heart\nBecause\nLove is all, you can see the wonders of your heart\nLove is all, it will tell how wonderful we are\nLove is all, you can see the magic of this world\nLove is all\nAll the money in the world won't get you far\nAdmit it's free and just right where you are\nYou may never know how close you are\nLove is all, you can see the wonders of your heart\nLove is all, it will tell how wonderful we are\nLove is all, you can see the magic of this world\nLove is all\nMakes you feel better, so much better,\nSo much better",
