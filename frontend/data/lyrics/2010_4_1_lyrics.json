    "lyrics": "To be honest – you're perfect\nUs two, it's nothing but all good\nYou say we're right for each other\nSo why can't you make up your mind?\nPlease no \"don't know\"s, please there's no \"maybe\"s\nI don't want these loose ends no more, uh-oh\nI'm sick of explanations, special reasons, excuses and lies\nSo just stop, stop, stop pretending; make up your mind\nSo just stop, stop – or I'm suspending; make up your mind\nI don't want anything to do, to do with you if you can't promise me\nSo just stop, stop, stop pretending; I'm telling you to stop\nI know I'm not stupid, that you need your only privacy\nYou should know by now that I've got a life on my own\nI know you like things, just like they are, but I can't do this no more\nSo sick of explanations, special reasons, excuses and lies\nSo just stop, stop, stop pretending; make up your mind\nSo just stop, stop – or I'm suspending; make up your mind\nI don't want anything to do, to do with you if you can't promise me\nSo just stop, stop, stop pretending; I'm telling you to stop\nOoh yeah\nWhy don't ya, don't ya, don't ya stop?\nWhy don't ya, don't ya, don't ya stop?\nWhy don't ya, don't ya, don't ya stop, stop, stop?\nYou say that you're afraid of commitment, yeah\nYou mean our history is never ending date, too late\nStop, (stop, stop, stop pretending; make up your mind)\nSo just stop, stop, stop – or I'm suspending; make up your mind\nI don't want anything to do, to do (with you if you can't promise me)\nYeah, yeah, (So just stop, stop, stop pretending);\nOh, I'm telling you to stop\nStop, stop, stop\nStop, stop, stop",
