    "lyrics": "Well, I guess it wouldn't come as no surprise\nWhen my heart's been broken at least a million times\nIf I gave it all up for good\nThere were times I thought I would but I never could\nCause I know it's out there, I've seen the signs\nI refuse to think it's a lie\nI believe in love that has no ending\nLove is being real and not pretending\nCould be I'm the king of wishful thinking\nBut I still believe in love\nYou can tell me it's all fairytales and dreams\nBy the way things look, yeah that's the way it seems\nBut the fact that it's hard to find\nDon't mean it's all in my mind at least not to me\nCause I know it's out there, it has to be\nAnd I know it's waiting for me\nI believe in love that has no ending\nLove is being real and not pretending\nCould be I'm the king of wishful thinking\nBut I still believe in love\nI believe in love that has no ending\nLove is being real and not pretending\nCould be I'm the king of wishful thinking\nBut I still believe in love\nSoon, someday soon, the one will appear, for me\nAnd I, oh-oh I will be waiting right here, you'll see\nI believe in love that has no ending\nLove is being real and not pretending (not pretending)\nCould be I'm the king of wishful thinking (yeah)\nBut I still believe in love\nI believe in love that has no ending\nLove is being real and not pretending\nCould be I'm the king of wishful thinking\nBut I still believe in love\nStill believe in love\n(Ah ah ah ah)\nStill believe in love\n(Ah ah ah ah)\nI still believe\n(Ah ah ah ah)\nIn love\nBut I still believe in love",
