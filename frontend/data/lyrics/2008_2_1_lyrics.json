    "lyrics": "It's time to break the chain\nTo bring the level up\nBeyond the peak of gain\nHigher and higher\nAll our senses come together\nWhen we get it to the music\nIt's lifting us up\nGive me love in stereo\nGive me more of the attraction\nCause I'm dying for some more\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nGive me love in stereo\nGive me total satisfaction\nCause I gotta have it all\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nIt's time to detonate\nWere losing sanity\nStill getting over me\nKeep pushing the senses\nGetting part of the illusion\nWhen we get it to the music\nIt's lifting us up\nGive me love in stereo\nGive me more of the attraction\nCause I'm dying for some more\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nGive me love in stereo\nGive me total satisfaction\nCause I gotta have it all\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nYou've got the best of me\nYou'll get the rest of what is left\nGive me love in stereo\nGive me more of the attraction\nCause I'm dying for some more\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nGive me love in stereo\nGive me total satisfaction\nCause I gotta have it all\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh",
