    "lyrics": "(Ah ah)\nI can't believe the news, oh boy\n(You should have listened when they're talking)\nYou're treating me just like a toy\n(Must be a rumour around walking)\nDon't let go, if you want me\nLet me know it's now or never\nDon't let go, you will never, ever\nFind a love that's better\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nEverytime you're fooling around\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nYou really gotta hold on me now\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nTime's up, time's up\nIf you don't listen, look and stop\n(Ah)\nSay, did you cheat on me last night?\n(There's no need for you to worry)\nI cross my heart and hope you're right\n(Well, I don't have to say I'm sorry)\nDon't let go, if you want me\nLet me know it's now or never\nDon't let go, you will never, ever\nFind a love that's better\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nEverytime you're fooling around\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nYou really gotta hold on me now\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nTime's up, time's up\nIf you don't listen, look and stop\n(Ah)\nDon't let go, I still want you\nAnd I need you more than ever\nDon't let go, you will never, ever\nFind a love that's better\nOoooh\n(Stop! Look! Listen!)\n(You don't know what you're missing)\nYou will never find any better\n(Everytime you're fooling around)\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nEverytime you're fooling around\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nYou really gotta hold on me now\nStop! Look! Listen!\nYou don't know what you're missing\nTime's up, time's up\nIf you don't listen, look and stop",
