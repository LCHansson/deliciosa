    "lyrics": "Here I stand by your side\nIt's been a while since we've talked about the future\nI can't lie, it's how I feel\nThere's only so much love for me to give\nAnd I can't see, you wanna stay a little longer\nI can't breathe, I can't do this anymore\nChorus:\nHe is always on my mind\nHe is always by my side\nAnd I can't let him go\nEvery minute of my time\nEvery moment every night\nIn my dreams he's alive\nAlways on my mind\nNo more words in this room\nI'm sorry but I hope you understand me\nI'm telling you\nGo away, don't look back\nCause' there's nothing more for me to say\nCause' I can't speak if the pain is getting stronger\nI can't breathe, I can't take it anymore\nChorus\nNow we're standing at the edge of the line\nAnd I will miss him for the rest of my life\nChorus",
