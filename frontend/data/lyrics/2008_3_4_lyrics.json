    "lyrics": "The one I used to love\nEncountered my best friend\nThat was a point in life when love was coming to an end\nI promise not to lie\nYou may think that I do\nSince no one will believe you when a dream is coming true\nYou are everything and more\nNever felt this way before\nLet me know how much you care\nLove, your beauty makes me blind\nTear those walls within my mind\nWhen you need me I'll be there\nI thought I'd never heal\nA violated trust\nI have been injured in a war of honour versus lust\nI hope I'm not naive\nI put my trust in you\nI hope you will believe me that my dream is coming true\nYou are everything and more\nNever felt this way before\nLet me know how much you care\nLove, your beauty makes me blind\nTear those walls within my mind\nWhen you need me I'll be there\nWhen I whispered in your ear\nThat I wanted you to stay\nYou assured me that you won't go away\nYou are everything and more\nNever felt this way before\nLet me know how much you care.\nLove, your beauty makes me blind\nTear those walls within my mind\nWhen you need me I'll be there\nWhen you need me I'll be there",
