    "lyrics": "Staring at a photograph\nOf where we used to be\nWhen the sky was bright\nAnd crystal clear\nAnd life was just a breeze, oh well\nThere's somethings taking you over\nYou burned all your bridges\nAnd you left without a clue\nAnd you wonder why these memories\nKeeps staring back at you, oh well\nNow don't look over you shoulder\nSing for life, sing for joy\nSing for every man and woman\nGirl and boy\nSing a song, a simple melody\nSing out loud or just hum\nSing for moments in the past\nAnd times to come\nSing for history and destiny\nWon't you sing for me?\nStanding at the station\nAnd you don't know where to go\nYou're trying hard to hold on to\nThe world you used to know, oh well\nDon't let it get to you baby\nSing for life, sing for joy\nSing for every man and woman\nGirl and boy\nSing a song, a simple melody\nSing out loud or just hum\nSing for moments in the past\nAnd times to come\nSing for history and destiny\nWon't you sing for me?\nDon't look back\nJust keep moving on\nGet your feel and walk\nInto a different song\nDon't care what they\nSay just let the music play\nHeeeey\nWon't you sing for me?\nSing for me\nSing for me\nSing for life, sing for joy\nSing for every man and woman\nGirl and boy\nSing a song, a simple melody\nSing out loud or just hum\nSing for moments in the past\nAnd times to come\nSing for history and destiny\nWon't you sing for me?\nSing for me",
