(Hello, hello)\nWelcome to my life. (to my life)\nWelcome to this world of mine.\nHello, hello, hello, hello do it my way.\nDriving in the fast lane.\nLiving, out loud.\nWelcome to my life.\n(oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah)\nWelcome to my life.\n(oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah)\nWelcome to my life.",
