    "lyrics": "There's a new world outside\nYour door and you don't\nNew world outside your door\nAnd you don't recognize a thing\nA switch from a steady\nDepression to an anxiety attack\nTo ask for thanks is proof\nOf needed brains that someone lacks\nWould you wanna go around\nIn that state of chain for life\nSee you pick the lock and before\nYou're free you'll be running for a while\nI don't understand, you don't understand\nThe solution that I bring\nI was hoping my help be praised\nAnd soon I'd hear you sing\nHallelujah new world\nCome dancing thru these streets\nWith a message of love\nHallelujah new world\nNow I see the days\nBefore these were absurd\nIs there a chance for something\nGood to come out of this\nThe theory of Gap and Core\nIt certainly exists\nWell, up and down and back and forth\nMy mind has lost it's range\nA hungry monster coming on\nOr an unavoidable change\nHallelujah new world\nCome dancing thru these streets\nWith a message of love\nHallelujah new world\nNow I see the days\nBefore these were absurd\nI'm sorry I don't know enough\nTo tell right from wrong\nIn this chaotic mess\nNot sure anyone does\nBut if, then tell me what's best\nHallelujah new world\nCome dancing thru these streets\nWith a message of love\nHallelujah new world\nNow I see the days\nBefore these were absurd\nHallelujah new world\nCome dancing thru these streets\nWith a message of love\nHallelujah new world\nNow I see the days\nBefore these were absurd\nHallelujah new world\nCome dancing thru these streets\nWith a message of love\nHallelujah new world\nNow I see the days\nBefore these were absurd",
