    "lyrics": "Here she comes, there she goes\nShe's the girl no one knows\nOne of the invisible people, yeah\nShe's got style, so much class\nWhat the hell, no one cares\nAbout the invisible people\nHow does it feel?\nBeing left on the outside\nWhen no one saw you coming, join the club\nWe're the invisible people (invisible people)\nStuck on the outside, trying to get in\nWe're the invisible people (invisible people)\nYou're just another face in a crowded place\nWhere no one can see you\nBut me\nWhen you're old in the dark\nAnother stranger in the park\nOne of the invisible people, yeah\nSay hello, no reply\nSay hello, say goodbye\nIt's undeniable\nHow does it feel?\nBeing left on the outside\nWhen no one saw you coming, join the club\nWe're the invisible people (invisible people)\nStuck on the outside, trying to get in\nWe're the invisible people (invisible people)\nYou're just another face in a crowded place\nWhere no one can see you\nBut me\nYou're so tired of being all alone\nAnd you want to be remembered\nAnd no one ever calls you on the phone\nYou're longing so badly for company\nYou wanna make a change in history\nLa la la la la, la la la la\nWe're the invisible people\nLa la la la la, la la la la\nWe're the invisible people\nWhen no one saw you coming, join the club\nWe're the invisible people (invisible people)\nStuck on the outside, trying to get in\nWe're the invisible people (invisible people)\nYou're just another face in a crowded place\nWhere no one can see you\n(No one can see you, no one can see you)\nBut me",
