    "lyrics": "You see, there are times when the doubts get to me\nThere are days when my mouth just won't speak\nWhen the world seems to love that I'm weak, that I'm weak\nYou'd always come through, you'd always stayed true\nWhen no one else would\nYou'd die for my sins, you'd fix everything\nWhen no one else could\nAnd I'd always believe you'd be covering me\nWhen no one else would, no one else could\nYou know, there are feelings that I never showed\nI have fears that nobody will know\nThere is sadness that grows from below\nBut I know\nYou'd always come through, you'd always stayed true\nWhen no one else would\nYou'd die for my sins, you'd fix everything\nWhen no one else could\nAnd I'd always believe you'd be covering me\nWhen no one else would, no one else could\n(That no one else, like no one else)\nWhen nothing works and nothing fix and nothing turns out good\nYou'd always come through, you'd always stayed true\nWhen no one else would\nAnd I always believed you'd be covering me\nWhen no one else would\nYou'd always gone through, you'd always stayed true\nWhen no one else would\nYou'd die for my sins, you'd fix everything\nWhen no one else could\nAnd I'd always believe you'd be covering me\nWhen no one else would, no one else could",
