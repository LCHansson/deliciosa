    "lyrics": "You\nCan't stand beside me\nAnd think you know me\nI am waisting my time\nI pray, to cut you free of me\nAnd come to see me\nI have mountains to climb\nAnd I'm leaving home\nI am looking, I'm not loosing what I found\nNo matter what you think I'll always be around\nTo be near you, I can hear you, I'm not on my own\nSo I'm leaving home\nSome\nSay that he changed me\nOr that he made me\nSee this falling behind\nHow many can face me\nAnd still amaze me\nI'm disarming my mind\nAnd I'm leaving home\nI am looking, I'm not loosing what I found\nNo matter what you think I'll always be around\nTo be near you, I can hear you, I'm not on my own\nSo I'm leaving home\nCertain things I found inside\nMaking a rebell is a long and stormy ride\nAnd I'm leaving home\nI am looking, I'm not loosing what I found (leaving home)\nNo matter what you think I'll always be around\nTo be near you, I can hear you, I'm not on my own\nTo be near you, I can hear you, I'm not on my own\nSo I'm leaving home\nBut I'm coming home for good",
