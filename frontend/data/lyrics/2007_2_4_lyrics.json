I need another lover\nRight here, right now\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\nHey! Let's meet under the cover\nI show you how\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\n(Hey! Hey!)\nThere's no excuse for\nSweet romancing baby\nI blow your fuse\nWhen you're out\nWell then so am I, all I can do\nPraying the right one is you\n(Hey!)\nLike a cat in the deep\nOf the night\nMoving round and round\nAnd I'm in command\n(Wow!)\nHey, I need another lover\nRight here, right now\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\nHey, let's meet under the cover\nI show you how\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\n(Hey!)\nOohooh\nI try to see if this is right\nWith the moonlight kiss\nA snap of my fingers\nI'm back in command\n(Wow!)\nCome on! Come on!\nHey, I need another lover\nRight here, right now\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\nHey, let's meet under the cover\nI show you how\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\nHey, I need another lover\nRight here, right now\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\nHey, let's meet under the cover\nI show you how\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, babe?\nWhat's your name, baby?\nWhat's your name, baby?",
