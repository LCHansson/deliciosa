    "lyrics": "She passes by, with or without her beautiful smile\nI wonder if I, even have the courage to ask her out\nBut I live by the dream, to find the reason, to tell her\nPut your favorite dress on girl, cause I'm gonna rock your world\nThere´s a place where you never have been before\nLooking at the moon outside, It's getting pretty bright tonight\nFeel the beat of my heart, cause I´m falling\nIt's another day, and now I know what I have to say\nI call her name, and she lights up and comes my way\nSo I live by the dream, to find the reason, to tell her\nPut your favorite dress on girl, cause I'm gonna rock your world\nThere´s a place where you never have been before\nLooking at the moon outside, It's getting pretty bright tonight\nFeel the beat of my heart, cause I´m falling down, yeah, yeah\nSpare a minute of your time, gonna make you mine\nThere is nothing in my way when I sweep your heart away, today\nPut your favorite dress on girl, cause I'm gonna rock your world\nThere´s a place where you never have been before\nLooking at the moon outside, It's getting pretty bright tonight\nFeel the beat of my heart, cause I´m falling\nFeel the beat of my heart, cause I´m falling",
