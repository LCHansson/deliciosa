    "lyrics": "(O o oh)\n(Love so beautiful)\n(Aah)\nIt's over, the curtain calls\nI have to move on, I need to be strong, I must let you go\nI've been crying, I haven't slept at all\nI've been wondering all those nights\nYou've been away from home\nTell me what's wrong\nTell me, have you met someone\nBut that's all right\nIf I can't make you stay\nSeven days and seven nights\n(Aaah)\nA love so beautiful\nAnd we just let it die\nWe could find a way back\nAnd learn how to stay alive\nAs long as we ask for love\nYou've been lying, yeah, you've been untrue\nBeen away one week without calling\nBroke my heart in two\nStill I miss you\nI'm about to break\nEvery dream we shared, all the hopes we had, all our memories\nTell me what's wrong\nTell me, have you met someone\nBut that's all right\nIf I can't make you stay\nSeven days and seven nights\n(Aaah)\nA love so beautiful\nAnd we just let it die\nWe could find a way back\nAnd learn how to stay alive\nAs long as we ask for love\nSeven days and seven nights\nAnd we just let it die\nWe could find a way back\nAnd learn how to stay alive\nYes, we could find a way back\nAnd learn how to stay alive\nAs long as we ask for love\nSeven days and seven nights\nAnd we just let it die\nSeven days and seven nights",
