    "lyrics": "My heart is screaming out your name\nNight falls, my mind recalls the sound of your hard breathing\nThoughts of your thousand kisses burning on my skin\nI feel your desire as a moonlight lingers in the sky\nI'm walking through fire, can't you hear me when I cry\nOne night of passion, one night of hunger\nAnd my attraction is getting stronger\nI need to feel you, I need to hold you\nI can't deny 'cause my heart is screaming out your name\nMy heart is screaming out your name\nTonight I won't be alone, doesn't mean that I'm not lonely\nOne minute is like an hour until you come my way\nI feel your desire as a moonlight lingers in the sky\nI walking through fire, can't you hear me when I cry\nOne night of passion, one night of hunger\nAnd my attraction is getting stronger\nI need to feel you, I need to hold you\nI can't deny 'cause my heart is screaming out your name\nMy heart is screaming out your name\nEvery time you're not around\nYou're the thoughts within my mind\nHold me near, never fear\nI'm right beside\nOne night of passion, one night of hunger\nAnd my attraction is getting stronger\nI need to feel you, I need to hold you\nI can't deny 'cause my heart is screaming out your name\nOne night of passion, one night of hunger\nAnd my attraction is getting stronger\nI need to feel you, I need to hold you\nI can't deny 'cause my heart is screaming out your name",
