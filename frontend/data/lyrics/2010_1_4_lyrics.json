    "lyrics": "This time I've tried not to get hurt\nThis time I'll stay untouched by pain and dirt\nThis time I'll stick to what I've learned\nThis time I'll fly so low I won't get burned\nMaybe it's not enough\nMaybe this time it's just too much\nMaybe I'm not that tough\nMaybe this time the road is just too rough\nWalk down\nSo I sit down\nI've walked this road so many years\nI've worned out all my boots\nI've cried all tears\nSo many cross roads left behind\nSo many choices burned in to my mind\nMaybe it's not enough\nMaybe this time it's just too much\nMaybe I'm not that tough\nMaybe this time the road is just too rough\nTo take me home x3\nBut I walk on",
