    "lyrics": "This morning she woke up and found\nAll of the thousand tears that she had cried\nA million times, they all had dried\nThe moment she got out of bed\nThere was no voice inside her head that said\n\"I'm falling down, this can't be right\"\nThis woman's gonna rise\nShe's only getting stronger before his eyes\nShe holds a strength that he didn't know\nBut she knows, now she knows\nThat she's worth so much more\nHe only seemed to let her down\nHe told her that she was never worth this while\nShe fell apart with a broken heart\nBut after all the pain is gone\nShe knew that what doesn't kill you makes you strong\nAnd after all she's standing tall\nThis woman's gonna rise\nShe's only getting stronger before his eyes\nShe holds a strength that he didn't know\nBut she knows, now she knows\nThat she's worth so much more\nThis woman's gonna rise\nShe's only getting stronger before his eyes\nRising up with a strenght that she never show\nBut she knows, now she knows\nThat she's worth so much more\nThis woman\nThis woman\nOohh, this woman\nHe was wrong (he was wrong)\nShe was right\nBut after all the pain is gone\nShe knew that what doesn't kill you makes you strong\nAnd after all she's standing tall\nThis woman's gonna rise\nThis woman's gonna rise, yeah, yeah, yeah\nShe's only getting stronger before his eyes\nShe holds a strength that he didn't know\nBut she knows, now she knows\nThat she's worth so much more\nThis woman's gonna rise (this woman)\nShe's only getting stronger before his eyes\nRising up with a strength that she never show\nBut she knows, now she knows\nThat she's worth so much more\nThis woman\nThis woman's gonna rise\nYeah",
