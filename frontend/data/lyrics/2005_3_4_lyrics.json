    "lyrics": "(Don't leave me, don't you leave me, yeah)\nHow many times must a woman compete\nBefore she's falling fair on the ground\nOh, how it's hurting inside\nThat you making me cry\nIt's too easy for you when you're saying goodbye\nYou make me feel that I'm falling in love\nAnd I know that my heart must be strong\nI have been stranded but I'm holding on\nNow you walk away, you turn away\nAnd leave me with nothing at all\nThis world, full of lies and deceit\nHow you got to struggle for love\nI'm telling you, if you're not the one that I need\nNo way you gonna take up my time\nBut how it hurts that I need you\nThat I'm making to see you\nI'm out of your reach but I try to believe\nYou make me feel that I'm falling in love\nAnd I know that my heart must be strong\nI have been stranded but I'm holding on\nNow you walk away, you turn away\nAnd leave me with nothing at all\nDeep in the cold of the night\nI'm frozen inside of this world\nDon't you know what it means\nFor someone like me\nI'm burning 'cause nothing is stronger\nThan the love that I give\nYou make me feel that I'm falling in love\nAnd I know that my heart must be strong\nI have been stranded but I'm holding on\nNow you walk away, you turn away\nAnd leave me with nothing at all\nLeave me with nothing at all",
