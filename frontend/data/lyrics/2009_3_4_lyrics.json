    "lyrics": "You might think that I am radical\nBut I can't go around pretending life is fine\nNo no\nDon't even miss when love was magical\nSo please don't bother buying me flowers when you're\nGone, gone, gone\nBaby goodbye, baby farewell\nI don't wanna lie, we can't stay together, my friend\nThis is the end, the picture is drawn\nYou're not even on, because you're\nGone, gone, gone\nI never been the calm and quiet one\nWhen people say that I'm off the leash\nI'm not even begun\nBaby goodbye, baby farewell\nI don't wanna lie, we can't stay together, my friend\nThis is the end, the picture is drawn\nYou're not even on, because you're\nGone, gone, gone\nI don't wanna see\nI don't wanna know\nI don't wanna hear\nIf you're all alone\nFeeling so free now that you're gone\nBaby goodbye, baby farewell\nI don't wanna lie, we can't stay together, my friend\nThis is the end, the picture is drawn\nYou're not even on, because you're\nGone, gone, gone",
