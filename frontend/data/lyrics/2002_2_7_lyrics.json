    "lyrics": "(Don't ever stop)\nAll right, girls\n(Are you shaking?)\nSurrounded by sharp looking eyes\nDancing in a fever\nForgetting all the worlds of advice\nMoving in and closer\nWhat a life we have\nWhat a life we live\nAnd it's smiling bright at us\nWhat a life we share\nGonna get it there\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\nSurrender to the beat up and down\nAnd the heat will be shaky, shaky\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\nAnd when the night is over\nI'll take you in my arms now\nBlinded by the scent of your love\nSailing on this feeling\nAnd my mind is high up above\nI don't know if I'm dreaming\nWhat a life we have\nWhat a life we live\nAnd it's smiling bright at us\nWhat a life we share\nGonna get it there\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\nSurrender to the beat up and down\nAnd the heat will be shaky, shaky (will be shaky)\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\n(And we will reach the top)\nSurrender to the beat up and down\nAnd the heat will be shaky, shaky\nWhat a life we have\nWhat a life we live\n(And when the night is over)\nWhat a life we share\nGonna get it there\n(I'll take you in my arms)\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\nSurrender to the beat up and down\nAnd the heat will be shaky, shaky\n(Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky)\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\nAnd when the night is over\nI'll take you in my arms now\nSo never let it go never stop 'til you know\nWe'll be reaching for the top tonight\nSurrender to the beat up and down\nAnd the heat will be shaky, shaky\n(Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky)\nSo never let it go, never stop",
