Maybe\nAm I a sad boy? Let's see\nI can't remember crying since I was a child (aha)\nDon't need a baby sitter (aha)\nNo I am not that bitter (aha)\nI get my satisfaction every now and then\nIn tears of joy and lack of sorrow (lack of sorrow)\nI live my life the way I planned\nI am not a sinner nor a saint\nNot that I would lose my head and faint\nEverytime we touch no\nAm I forgiven\nLivin' and lovin' my way\nI am not a sinner nor a saint\nYou never gonna break my heart I ain't\nGonna let it happen no\nAm I forgiven\nConfessions are made in the name of myself\nAaaaaaah\nNot that I would lose my head and faint\nEverytime we touch no\nAm I forgiven\nLivin' and lovin' my way\nI am not a sinner nor a saint\nYou never gonna break my heart I ain't\nGonna let it happen no\nAm I forgiven\nConfessions are made in the name of myself",
