    "lyrics": "My friends keep saying\nThat I need patience\nFools rush in, better slow down\nThey keep talkin' 'bout good things come\nBut I don't wanna wait\nMy heart is achin'\nI'm not mistaken\nThe moment I saw you\nMy whole world started to change\nYou could be what I've been lookin' for\nI come back for more\nAnd I want you to know\nI wanna feel love love love\nLift me up to the sky\nOh give me love love love\nTake me higher than high\nI will show you heaven\nWhen I get you alone\nI don't wanna wait anymore\nYou see right through me\nCan't hide it for you\nYou read my mind\nBut I refuse to feel shame\nIt's not a crime to want love and more\nIt's happened before\nAnd I want you to know\nI wanna feel love love love\nLift me up to the sky\nOh give me love love love\nTake me higher than high\nI will show you heaven\nWhen I get you alone\nI don't wanna wait anymore\nI'm waiting for a sign\nThat you made up your mind\nDon't keep me hangin' on forever\nDon't waste another night\nI don't wanna wait no more\nI wanna feel love love love\nLift me up to the sky (Don't wanna wait)\nOh give me love love love\nTake me higher than high\nI will show you heaven\nWhen I get you alone\nI don't wanna wait anymore\nI wanna feel love love love (Oh! oooh Oh!)\nLift me up to the sky\nOh give me love love love (Give me love, give me love)\nTake me higher than high\nI will show you heaven\nWhen I get you alone\nI don't wanna wait anymore\nlove love love\nI don't wanna wait\nI don't wanna wait\nanymore",
