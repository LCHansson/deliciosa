    "lyrics": "It was to late to try\nYou gave it up, you said goodbye\nI was holding your hand when the doctor said\nYou just past away\nI can't face the world without you\nNo matter how I try\nI would fly away to the moon and back\nTake a train on a one way track\nTo be close to you, to be close to you\nI would bring the sun when the rain falls down\nStop the world from spinning around\nTo be close to you, to be close to you\nI would if I could\nLife can be so unfair when someone else\nSomeone else is scared to death\nIn my heart you will live\nUntil it's time to see you again\nCan I face the world without you\nI don't know if I can\nI would fly away to the moon and back\nTake a train on a one way track\nTo be close to you, to be close to you\nIf i could\nWere the ocean meets the sky\nThat's were I will be\nWhen I spred my wing and fly\nWill you wait there for me\nIt was to late to try\nYou gave it up, you said goodbye\nI would fly away to the moon and back\nTake a train on a one way track\nTo be close to you, to be close to you\nI would bring the sun when the rain falls down\nStop the world from spinning around\nTo be close to you to be close to you\nI would If I could",
